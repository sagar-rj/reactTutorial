import InputBox from "./InputBox";

export { InputBox };


//In this code snippet, we are exporting the InputBox component from the components folder.
//The InputBox component is imported and exported in the index.js file.
// This allows us to import the InputBox component from the components folder using a single import statement in other files.
// This is a common practice in React projects to organize and manage components in a modular way.
